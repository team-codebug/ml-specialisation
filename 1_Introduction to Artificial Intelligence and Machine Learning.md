## 1. Difference Between AI, ML, and DL

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**  
- Broad concept where machines simulate human intelligence by sensing, reasoning, acting, and adapting to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.  
- **Example:** IBM's chess-playing Deep Blue defeated world champion Garry Kasparov using rule-based systems to mimic human strategic thinking.

**Machine Learning (ML):**  
- A subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn and improve from data over time without being explicitly programmed.  
- **Example:** Spam email detection systems classify emails based on patterns in labeled datasets.

**Deep Learning (DL):**  
- A specialized subset of ML using multi-layered neural networks to process vast amounts of data. These networks learn hierarchical representations for complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.  
- **Example:** Image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as identifying animals in photos.

**Hierarchy:**  
AI > ML > DL

## 2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Definition:**  
A branch of computer science that creates systems capable of mimicking cognitive functions like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

**Applications:**  
- **Image classification:** Identifying objects in images.  
- **Machine translation:** Translating text between languages (e.g., Google Translate).  

**Modern Examples:**  
- Autonomous vehicles combining computer vision, decision-making, and control.  
- Chatbots like ChatGPT simulating conversational understanding.

## 3. Machine Learning (ML)

**Definition:**  
Developing algorithms that improve performance as they are exposed to more data over time.  

**Types of Machine Learning:**  
1. **Supervised Learning:**  
   - Trained on labeled data.  
   - **Example:** Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and rooms.  
2. **Unsupervised Learning:**  
   - Finds patterns in unlabeled data.  
   - **Example:** Customer segmentation for targeted marketing.  
3. **Reinforcement Learning:**  
   - Learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback.  
   - **Example:** Training a robot to navigate a maze using rewards and penalties.

## 4. Deep Learning (DL)

**Definition:**  
Deep Learning uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to process data, recognize patterns, and handle complex tasks.

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Requires large datasets.  
- Uses specialized architectures like CNNs for images or RNNs for sequential data.

**Applications:**  
1. **Image Recognition:**  
   - Identifying objects in images with high accuracy (e.g., smartphone facial recognition).  
2. **Speech Recognition:**  
   - Converting spoken language into text (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant).  
3. **Autonomous Driving:**  
   - Detecting road objects, predicting trajectories, and making real-time decisions.
